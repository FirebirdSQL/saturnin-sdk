Version 0.8.0
=============

* Milestone 5.

  Saturnin SDK is an optional add-on package for Saturnin, that contains extensions
  related to development of Butler services for Saturnin. Currently it provides only
  one extension command for Saturnin console: `create standalone`.

  This command takes a Saturnin recipe and creates Python script that serves as
  standalone container to run services used by recipe. This script could be compiled
  by `Nuitka`_ Python compiler.

  .. note:: This script currently does not support Saturnin applications.
